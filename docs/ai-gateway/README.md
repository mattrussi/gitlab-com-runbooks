## Summary

The AI-gateway is a standalone-service that will give access to AI features to all users of GitLab, no matter which
instance they are using: self-managed, dedicated or GitLab.com.

The AI Gateway was formerly known as Model Gateway and Code Suggestions.

## Operational Roles and Responsibilities

1. Regional deployment management - The AI-Gateway team is responsible for selecting, provisioning and de-provisioning regional deployments. Selection and provisioning can be self-served via the runway config ([multi region docs](https://runway-docs-4jdf82.runway.gitlab.net/guides/multi-region/)). Currently deprovisioning should be requested by contacting the Runway team.
2. Quota Saturation Monitoring and Response - The AI-Gateway team is responsible for monitoring the saturation warnings and responding to the warnings when raised.

## Architecture

See the AI Gateway architecture blueprint at <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/ai_gateway/>

For a higher level view of how the AI Gateway fits into our AI Architecture, see
<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/ai_architecture.html>

### Example API call graph

For context, here is a typical call graph for a Code Suggestions API request from an IDE on an end-user's laptop.  This call graph is current as of 2023-12-15 but may change in the future.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    box User laptop
    actor User
    participant IDE as VSCode
    participant LS as LanguageServer process
    end
    box Cloudflare POP nearest to User
    participant CFGL as gitlab.com
    end
    box GitLab Rails AI-assisted infrastructure
    participant WH as Workhorse
    participant RB as Rails
    end
    box Cloudflare POP nearest to Rails
    participant CFCS as codesuggestions.gitlab.com
    end
    box GitLab AI-gateway infrastructure (GCP)
    participant GW as AI gateway
    end
    box Model engine service
    participant ML as ML model engine (Vertex or Anthropic)
    end

```

Notes:

* Over the last few months, the endpoints and control flow have evolved, sometimes in non-backward-compatible ways.
  * e.g. Prior to GitLab 16.3, clients directly accessed a now deprecated request endpoint `/v2/completions`.  Some self-managed GitLab deployments running older versions while Code Suggestions was still in beta release may still be using those now-broken endpoints.
* Transits Cloudflare twice, once from end-user to Rails [AI Assisted](../ai-assisted/README.md), and later from Rails to `ai-gateway`.
  * Typically at least one of those is fairly low latency: only 10 ms RTT between GCP's `us-east1` region and Cloudflare's `ATL` POP.
  * Cloudflare tools (logs, analytics, rules, etc.) are available for both of those API calls.
* The requests to `ai-gateway` are expected to be slow, so Rails composes the request headers and then delegates it for Workhorse to send that request to `ai-gateway`.  (Workhorse can handle slow requests much more efficiently than Rails; this conserves puma worker threads.)
* Caching and reuse of TCP and TLS sessions allows most requests to avoid extra round-trips for connection setup.
* Currently `ai-gateway` containers run as a GCP Cloud Run service.
  * See the Cloud Run [docs](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/resource-model) and [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/detail/us-east1/ai-gateway/metrics?project=gitlab-runway-production).
  * Those containers are not accessible via the tools we use for GKE-based services (`kubectl`, etc.).
  * The `gcloud` CLI tool exposes specs for the containers and their revisions (deployments).

Starter `gcloud` commands:

```
$ gcloud run services describe --project gitlab-runway-production --region us-east1 --format yaml ai-gateway
$ gcloud run revisions list --project gitlab-runway-production --region us-east1 --service ai-gateway
```

## Deployment

AI Gateway is deployed through Runway:

* [Runway Deployment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/platform/runway/deployments/ai-gateway)
* [Runway Service](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/detail/us-east1/ai-gateway/metrics?project=gitlab-runway-production)

For more details, refer to [Runway runbook](../runway/README.md).

## Environments

* [Production](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/platform/runway/deployments/ai-gateway/-/environments/15709878)
* [Staging](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/platform/runway/deployments/ai-gateway/-/environments/15709877)

## Regions

* [Runway Multi-Region Documentation](https://runway-docs-4jdf82.runway.gitlab.net/guides/multi-region/#regional-service)

When the decision is made to provision a new region, the following steps should be taken:

1. Request a quota increase in the new region (for instructions see [this section below](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/ai-gateway/README.md#gcp-quotas))
1. Follow the [Runway documentation to set up the new region](https://docs.runway.gitlab.com/guides/multi-region/)
1. Notify the [testing team](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/test-platform/) that a new region has been set up so that they can run the necessary tests. Our current contact is Abhinaba Ghosh and the active Slack channel is #ai-gateway-testing.

## Services and Accounts

The Cloud Run service accounts are managed by Runway and have `aiplatform.user` role set, granting the service accounts the `aiplatform.endpoints.predict` permission. Other permissions granted by this role are unused. To set [additional roles](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-infra/platform/runway/provisioner/inventory.schema.html#inventory_items_additional_roles), update `ai-gateway` entry in Runway [provisioner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/platform/runway/provisioner/-/blob/main/inventory.json?ref_type=heads).
This IAM membership is managed via the `gl-infra/config-mgmt` repository, using Terraform.

* [Service Account Configuration](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/blob/main/environments/ai-framework-prod/service_accounts.tf?ref_type=heads#L7)

## Performance

AI Gateway includes the following SLIs/SLOs:

* [Apdex](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ai-gateway-main/ai-gateway3a-overview?orgId=1&viewPanel=380731558)
* [Error Rate](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ai-gateway-main/ai-gateway3a-overview?orgId=1&viewPanel=144302059)

Service degradation could be result of the following saturation resources:

* [Memory Utilization](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ai-gateway-main/ai-gateway3a-overview?orgId=1&from=now-1h&to=now&viewPanel=377718254)
* [CPU Utilization](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ai-gateway-main/ai-gateway3a-overview?orgId=1&from=now-1h&to=now&viewPanel=1050857443)
* [Instance Utilization](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ai-gateway-main/ai-gateway3a-overview?orgId=1&from=now-1h&to=now&viewPanel=1738137433)
* [Concurency Utilization](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ai-gateway-main/ai-gateway3a-overview?orgId=1&from=now-1h&to=now&viewPanel=4285373877)
* [Vertex AI API Quota Limit](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ai-gateway-main/ai-gateway3a-overview?orgId=1&from=now-1h&to=now&viewPanel=1515902021)

## Scalability

AI Gateway will autoscale with traffic. To manually scale, update [`runway.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist/-/blob/main/.runway/runway.yml?ref_type=heads) based on [documentation](../runway/README.md#scalability).

It is also possible to directly edit the tunables for the `ai-gateway` service via the [Cloud Run console's Edit YAML interface](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/detail/us-east1/ai-gateway/yaml/view?project=gitlab-runway-production).  This takes effect faster, but be sure to make the equivalent updates to the `runway.yml` as described above; otherwise the next deploy will revert your manual changes to the service YAML.

### Capacity Planning

AI Gateway uses [capacity planning](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/) provided by Runway for long-term forecasting of saturation resources. To view forecasts, refer to [Tamland page](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-infra/capacity-planning-trackers/gitlab-com/service_groups/ai-gateway/).

### GCP Quotas

Apart from our quota monitoring in our usual GCP projects, the AI Gateway relies on resources that live in the following projects:

* `gitlab-ai-framework-dev`
* `gitlab-ai-framework-stage`
* `gitlab-ai-framework-prod`

Refer to
<https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-infra/tamland/saturation.html?highlight=code_suggestions#other-utilization-and-saturation-forecasting-non-horizontally-scalable-resources>
for quota usage trends and projections.

Many of our AI features use GCP's Vertex AI service. Vertex AI consists of various `base models` that represent logic for different types of AI models (such as code generation, or chat bots).
Each model has its own usage quota, which can be viewed in the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?referrer=search&project=gitlab-ai-framework-prod&pageState=(%22allQuotasTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22base_model_5C_22_22%257D%255D%22))).

To request a quota alteration:

* Visit the following page in the GCP Console: [Quotas by Base Model](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?referrer=search&project=gitlab-ai-framework-prod&pageState=(%22allQuotasTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22base_model_5C_22_22%257D%255D%22)))
* Select each base model that requires an quota decrease/increase
* Click 'EDIT QUOTAS'
* Input the desired quota limit for each service and submit the request.
* Existing/previous requests can be viewed [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas/qirs?referrer=search&project=gitlab-ai-framework-prod&pageState=(%22allQuotasTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22base_model_5C_22_22%257D%255D%22)))

If you do not have access to the GCP console, please file an access request asking for the `Quota Administrator` role on the `gitlab-ai-framework-prod` project.

## Monitoring/Alerting

AI Gateway uses both [custom metrics](../../metrics-catalog/services/ai-gateway.jsonnet) scrapped from application and default metrics provided by [Runway](../runway/README.md#monitoringalerting). Right now, alerts are routed to `#g_mlops-alerts` in Slack. To route to different channel, refer to [documentation](../uncategorized/alert-routing.md).

## Troubleshooting

### How do I rotate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`?

AI Gateway uses secrets management for Anthropic API key. To rotate a secret, refer to [documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/platform/runway/docs/-/blob/master/secrets-management.md?ref_type=heads#rotating-a-secret).

For troubleshooting deployment pipelines, refer to [Runway runbook](../runway/README.md#troubleshooting).
