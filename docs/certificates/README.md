# Gitlab Certificate Run Books

This is an overview of certificates, where they are used and how they can be replaced in their service.

## Deployment and replacement strategies

Currently we have multiple ways of deploying certificates. Please see the `Management` and `Details` columns to find the management process and other details to edit according to that documentation.

* [Chef Vault][chef-vault]
* [Chef Server][chef-server]
* [Chef Hybrid][chef-hybrid]
* [Cloudflare][cloudflare]
* [Forum][forum]
* [GCP Load Balancer][gcp]
* [GKMS and Vault][gkms] (automated using [Certificates Updater][certificates-updater])
* [Status.io][statusio]
* [ZenDesk][zendesk]

## General info

* COMODO has renamed to Sectigo, those names might get used interchangeably in this document. Any Certificate that is listed as issued by COMODO will in the future be issued by Sectigo.
* Our primary certificate source is [SSLMate](https://sslmate.com/console/orders/).

  * Using the above link it is possible to retrieve the current certificate file for each CN listed there.
  * Those files are permanent links to the public chain of the certificate. The key is *not* part of that chain.
  * Some tasks require the commandline tool (available via <https://sslmate.com/help/install> and `brew install sslmate`).

### Buy a new certificate

**Before buying a new certificate, please check if it is possible to use an automated Let's Encrypt certificate for your purpose!**

```shell
sslmate buy '<domain>' --auto-renew --approval=dns --key-type=ecdsa
```

Use `sslmate help buy` for additional options if needed.

But with the above example, this will purchase a certificate that expires after
1 year, will auto renew itself using DNS, and is of key type `ecdsa`.

We've chosen to go with `ecdsa` for it's improvements:

* Smaller size
* Improved TLS handshake speed
* Stronger algorithm

We have [Route53 integration with SSLMate](https://sslmate.com/account/integrations/add/aws)
so the DNS authorization will be done automatically.

The `sslmate` client will download the key and certificate to the directory in
which the command was executed.

*Make sure to add the new certificate to the list below!*

Also create a 1Password entry for the key (and the new cert) in the "SSLCerts Lockbox" vault.

### Renew a certificate

For older certificates we may not have renewal properly configured.  Let's
change that:

```shell
sslmate edit '<domain>' --approval=dns
sslmate renew '<domain>'
```

This will change the existing approval method to our fancy DNS integration, and
then force a renew.  You can then download the certificate:

```shell
sslmate download '<domain>'
```

Note that `sslmate` may complain that you won't have the key in your `${CWD}`.
This is fine as we should have the key on minimally on a server, but may also
exist inside of 1Password, and even better, inside a Chef vault.

#### Status.io-specific instructions

Status.io SSL certificate is being renewed manually. Status.io would silently
fail if provided with mismatching private key or certificate chain.

To update the certificate:

1. Login into <https://status.io/> using the `ops-contact+statusio@gitlab.com` username. Password is found in Production 1password vault.
1. Navigate to [settings > TLS/SSL](https://app.status.io/dashboard/5b36dc6502d06804c08349f7/settings/ssl).
1. Install [`sslmate` CLI tool](https://sslmate.com/help/cmdline/install).
1. Download the content of `status.gitlab.com.key.pem` from 1password Production vault.
1. Download the certificates from sslmate: `sslmate download status.gitlab.com`.
1. Upload the following keys in the [ssl settings](https://app.status.io/dashboard/5b36dc6502d06804c08349f7/settings/ssl)

   1. Certificate: `status.gitlab.com.crt`
   1. Private Key: `status.gitlab.com.key.pem`
   1. Certificate Chain: `status.gitlab.com.chain.crt` **NOT** `status.gitlab.com.chained.crt`

1. Click upload.

Previous renewals:

1. <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/5260>
1. <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/7562>

### Re-keying a certificate

If a certificate auto-renews but we have lost the private key, generate a new
one (and CSR) using SSLMate's web UI. Download the private key and create a
1password entry for it (and the new cert) in the "SSLCerts Lockbox" vault.

### Verify the certificate

Wait for Chef to converge, or force a convergence.

Use a tool such as <https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html> or <https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html> to verify that the certificate is live, working, and fully valid.

### Monitoring

We utilize Prometheus blackbox to regularly check endpoints and send us alerts
when those endpoints go down as well as validate and alert us at a threshold
when those certificates are going to expire.

See [SSL certificate expiration rules](../../rules/ssl-certificate-expirations.yml).

#### Modify list of hosts with SSL certificate

By editing list inside `prometheus.jobs.blackbox-ssl.target` attribute in the
role `prometheus-server` on Chef, you can add or remove server from monitoring
for SSL certificate expiration. By adding server there you will be receiving
alerts when there is less than 30 days remain for certificate expiration. Do
not forget to save your changes to `chef-repo` and run `chef-client` on the
Prometheus host to see changes.

### Safe execution of a update involving Chef nodes

1. Preparation:

   1. Check the state of chef-client:

      ```shell
      knife ssh "roles:${chef_role} AND chef_environment:${chef_env}" "systemctl status chef-client"`
      ```

   1. Stop Chef on the HAProxy fleet that serves the certificate in question:

      ```shell
      knife ssh "role:<role name>" "sudo service chef-client stop"
      ```

1. Do the change according to the table below
1. Slowly roll out Chef

   1. Inspect changes that would be applied on one of the nodes:

      ```shell
      sudo chef-client --why-run
      ```

   1. Force a chef-run on one of the nodes for verification. You should be able to simply run `sudo chef-client` and see the updated certificate in the output.
   1. Use `openssl` to verify the correct certificate is in place:

      ```shell
      openssl s_client -connect ${NODE IP ADDRESS}:443 -servername ${HOSTNAME} </dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text
      ```

      Check for dates and general information to match, such as the CN and SANs.
   1. Restart Chef on the nodes from the first step.

      ```shell
      knife ssh "role:${chef_role} AND chef_environment:${chef_env}" "sudo service chef-client start"
      ```
