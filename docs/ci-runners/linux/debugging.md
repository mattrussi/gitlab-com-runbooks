# Hosted Runners Debugging Guide

Debugging a hosted runner involves two main steps:

1. Verifying a runner-manager's ability to spin up ephemeral VMs.
2. Ensuring the ephemeral VMs can connect to GitLab.com or the CI Gateway.

## Part 1: Testing Ephemeral VM Creation

The most challenging aspect of testing runner-managers is composing the `docker-machine` command with all the required custom options. These options vary by manager, so we've created handy scripts to automate this process.

### Using `generate-create-machine.sh`

This script is typically located in the `/tmp` folder of runner-manager VMs. It generates another script based on the configurations in the `/etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml` file of each runner-manager.

#### Steps to Run

```bash
$ sudo su
# cd /tmp
# export VM_MACHINE=test1
# ./generate-create-machine.sh
# less create-machine.sh  # Review the generated script
# ./create-machine.sh     # Run the script
```

#### Example Output of a Successful Run

```plaintext
tmp# ./create-machine.sh

To connect your Docker Client to the Docker Engine running on this VM, run: docker-machine env test1
```

## Part 2: Testing Ephemeral VM Connectivity

Once the ephemeral VM is created successfully, you can verify its connectivity.

### Steps to Test Connectivity

```bash
# docker-machine ssh test1
cos@test1 ~ $ curl -IL https://us-east1-c.ci-gateway.int.gprd.gitlab.net:8989
cos@test1 ~ $ curl -IL https://gitlab.com
```

#### Expected Outcome

- A successful call will return a `200` status code.

- If any command times out, it may indicate a network misconfiguration.

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Common Issue: Network Misconfiguration

One frequent issue is a missing network configuration for the CI Gateway. Ensure that the network is allowed in the [CI Gateway configuration](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/blob/7a5022fafbcd268e34b3f08b4d86aea8699db328/environments/gprd/variables.tf#L224).

If problems persist, verify the VMâ€™s network settings and access permissions.
