## How to configure checks in Pingdom

* Pingdom checks are configured in the `pingdom/pingdom.yml` file
* On non-`master` branches, the `dryrun_pingdom_checks` CI job will (partially) validate the `pingdom.yml` file and will display changes that will be made via the Pingdom API (see [Dry-run Mode](#dry-run-mode) for details).
* When changes to this file are merged to `master`, the `deploy_pingdom_checks` GitLab CI will execute and make the actual changes:
* This job will perform 3 tasks:
  * It will insert any new checks that have been added to the file. These checks will be prefixed with `check:`
  * It will remove any checks in Pingdom with the prefix `check:` that are not in this file
  * It will update any other checks from `pingdom/pingdom.yml`

* **Note:** the pingdom script uses the `check:` prefix to signal that the check is managed by the script. **Any checks on Pingdom that use the `check:` prefix but are not on the master branch will be deleted the next time the master pipeline is executed**

### `pingdom.yml` Details

The `pingdom.yml` is structured as follows:

```yaml
unique_tag: "pingdom-automated" # This is a tag which only checks in this file should include
defaults:
  timeout_ms: 2000              # The default timeout in milliseconds
  resolution_minutes: 5         # The amount of time before raising an alert
integrations:                   # This maps from the names we use in this document to the IDS pingdom needs
  - name: pagerduty
    id: 65172                   # This can be found in the URL when editing an integration
checks:
  # Each check has the following structure
  - url: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/
    timeout_ms: 5000            # The timeout for this check
    notify_when_restored: true  # Send an alert when service is restored
    check_type: http            # Set to "tcp" to use a TCP check type. Other values are ignored, and http checks are created.
    check_port: 443             # Port to be used during TCP checks. Otherwise ignored.
    tags:                       # Any additional tags to add to the check
      - gitaly
      - database
    teams:                      # Teams to associate the check with. See Pingdom for a list of teams
      - Infrastructure
    integrations:
      - pagerduty
```

## Dry-run Mode

When run with the `--dry-run`, the script will execute in dry-run mode, which will display changes but without executing them against the Pingdom API.

It is always safe to run.

### Running Locally

You can run the script locally, so long as you provide the following environment variables, which can be found in Pingdom and 1Password.

```
export PINGDOM_USERNAME="gitlab-ops+pingdom@gitlab.com"
export PINGDOM_PASSWORD="..."
export PINGDOM_APPKEY="..."
export PINGDOM_ACCOUNT_EMAIL="..."
```

## Extracing availability metrics from Pingdom for further analysis

We can extract Pingdom availability metrics to CSV format using the `./pingdom/generate-availability-stats.sh` script.

Currently, this script can be executed manually. As a next step we should automate this process.

```shell
export PINGDOM_APP_KEY="..."
export PINGDOM_PASSWORD="..."
export PINGDOM_ACCOUNT_EMAIL="..."

$ ./pingdom/generate-availability-stats.sh

#Check,Date,Availability
"check:https://gitlab.com/","2018-10-24",1
"check:https://gitlab.com/","2018-10-25",1
"check:https://gitlab.com/","2018-10-26",1
"check:https://gitlab.com/","2018-10-27",1
```

This will generate raw data in a CSV format. This data can then be analysed further using Google Sheets or other analysis tools.

An example of this analysis is [Pingdom Availability Statistics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wn760s-neVJU5Jzd--24BwsoSkezF5vacBaHpxwgMpA/edit) spreadsheet, which pivots the data to generate availability
[KPI values](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NNne33rOtkrogqWRzdQZ4U3kiZdc2PC6B44WCpmQpNc/edit#) for GitLab.com.

## PagerDuty integration

PagerDuty to Pingdom integration is used for the Uptime checks and alert notifications.

The `pingdom` integration is configured in the PagerDuty for `GitLab Production` Service with a webhook. The webhook is attached to the Uptime checks in the Pingdom. The Uptime checks are configured in the `pingdom.yml` file and updated with CI.

## Pingdom Exporter

We have [pingdom exporter](https://github.com/jusbrasil/pingdom-exporter/) deployed in OPS through the [helmfiles](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-helmfiles/-/blob/5f983af3e7935d772bc06fe41f554d982171e763/bases/environments/ops.yaml#L229).

To limit the API requests made by the exporter we filter the checks picked up by the exporter.

It only queries checks which have the `pingdom-exporter-check` tag.
