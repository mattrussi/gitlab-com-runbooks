# Container Registry database post-deployment migrations

**Table of Contents**

[TOC]

## Context

Until recently the registry only had support for regular database schema migrations. After completing the GitLab.com registry upgrade/migration ([gitlab-org&5523](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5523)), we're now in a position where the database has grown enough to make simple changes (like creating new indexes) take a long time to execute, so we had to introduce support for post-deployment migrations.

Regular schema migrations are automatically applied by the registry helm chart using a migrations job, introduced in [gitlab-org/charts/gitlab#2566](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/2566). The mid/long-term goal is to have a similar automation for post-deployment migrations ([gitlab-org/charts/gitlab#3926](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/3926)).

Meanwhile, we're already feeling the need to ship post-deployment migrations, so we had to move forward with a short-term solution. This implies skipping any post-deployment migrations during deployments and then raising a change request to have these manually applied from within a registry instance after deploying a version that includes new post-deployment migrations.

This document provides instructions for SREs to apply post-deployment migrations.

There's a private recording from delivery team for applying the migrations: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFH11OE91Vw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFH11OE91Vw)

## Applying post-deployment migrations

This should be done from within a registry instance in K8s, using the built-in `registry` CLI. If needed, you can look at the relevant CLI documentation [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/blob/master/docs-gitlab/database-migrations.md#administration).

1. Confirm that the registry version indicated in the Change Request matches the one (and there is only one) running in the target environment ([dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/registry-app/registry-application-detail?orgId=1&from=now-5m&to=now&viewPanel=3));

1. Connect to any cluster from the environment for which maintenance is occurring ([runbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/kube/k8s-oncall-setup.md#kubernetes-api-access));

    **Note** that the regional clusters in `gprd` and `gstg` do not have any Registry pods. So, you can connect to any one of the three zonal clusters.

1. Find the oldest container registry Pod (ignore Pods that have `-migrations-` in the name!):

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -n gitlab -l app=registry --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp | head -n 2
   ```

1. Access the pod:

   ```sh
   kubectl exec -n gitlab -it <pod_name> -- /bin/bash
   ```

   If it's on a `gprd` cluster, notify `#security_operations` slack channel that you are exec-ing into the pod with
   a link to the change request, as they will receive a SIRT alert about it.

1. List pending migrations:

   ```sh
   SKIP_POST_DEPLOYMENT_MIGRATIONS=false registry database migrate status /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
   ```

   You should see something like this:

   ```text
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   |                                    MIGRATION                                    |               APPLIED                |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   | 20210503145024_create_top_level_namespaces_table                                | 2022-11-29 14:12:58.477128 +0000 WET |
   | 20220803114849_update_gc_track_deleted_layers_trigger                           | 2022-11-29 14:13:00.209522 +0000 WET |
   | ...                                                                             | ...                                  |
   | 20221123174403_post_add_layers_simplified_usage_index_batch_1 (post deployment) |                                      |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   ```

   In this example, there is one pending post-deployment migration named `20221123174403_post_add_layers_simplified_usage_index_batch_1`. You know it's pending because `APPLIED` is empty. You know it's a post-deployment because of the `(post deployment)` suffix.

   Note that we're explicitly disabling the `SKIP_POST_DEPLOYMENT_MIGRATIONS` environment variable for these commands. If we don't, then the registry CLI will ignore post-deployment migrations. This environment variable is set to `true` for our deployments ([sample](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/blob/62be0606e27a2af17d91d3857e914dc08a631283/releases/gitlab/values/gprd-cny.yaml.gotmpl#L224)) to avoid having these migrations applied alongside regular schema migrations during upgrades.

1. Confirm that there are no pending regular migrations in the list above;

1. Confirm that the number and name of pending post-deployment migrations matches those described in the change request;

1. Halt the execution if any of the above are false;

1. Proceed to apply post-deployment migrations:

   ```sh
   SKIP_POST_DEPLOYMENT_MIGRATIONS=false registry database migrate up /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
   ```

   You should see something like this:

   ```text
   20221123174403_post_add_layers_simplified_usage_index_batch_1
   OK: applied 1 migrations
   ```

1. Wait for the above to complete and confirm there are no pending migrations:

   ```sh
   registry database migrate status /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
   ```

   You should see something like this:

   ```text
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   |                                    MIGRATION                                    |               APPLIED                |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   | 20210503145024_create_top_level_namespaces_table                                | 2022-11-29 14:12:58.477128 +0000 WET |
   | 20220803114849_update_gc_track_deleted_layers_trigger                           | 2022-11-29 14:13:00.209522 +0000 WET |
   | ...                                                                             | ...                                  |
   | 20221123174403_post_add_layers_simplified_usage_index_batch_1 (post deployment) | 2022-12-14 12:31:57.42551 +0000 WET  |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   ```

   Note that `APPLIED` is no longer empty.

### Monitoring

The migrations tool used by the registry ([link](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate)) does not report when each individual migration has been applied, only when all pending are done (or one fails). As result, when applying multiple migrations, the registry CLI will output the list of all migrations to apply and wait for all to be applied (or for one to fail) before providing additional feedback (success or failure).

While the tool does not support realtime feedback, if applying multiple long-running migrations and wanting to know the progress of each one, we can use the `registry database migrate status /etc/docker/registry/config.yml` CLI command on another registry pod to see the list of migrations already applied.

Alternatively, we can look directly at the `schema_migrations` table (from where the `database migrate status` reads) on the registry database with the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY applied_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

The output will look like follows:

```text
                              id                               |          applied_at

```

As each migration is applied, it will be inserted in this table, with the current time set in `applied_at`. So we can glance at this query result when wondering how many have been already applied.
