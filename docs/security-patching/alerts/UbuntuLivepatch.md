## Overview

[Ubuntu Livepatch](https://ubuntu.com/security/livepatch) is a service that provides online security fixes for High/Critical level severity security vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. We use this service across our fleet in order to apply security fixes to systems that are difficult to reboot quickly.

## Services

- [Some Ubuntu VM instances](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/security-patching/linux-os/linux-os-patching.md?ref_type=heads#services) that are managed by Chef should be enrolled in Ubuntu Advantage and have Livepatch enabled. This alert checks if a node is enrolled into Ubuntu Pro subscription and does not have Livepatch enabled.

## Metrics

- The metric used for this alert is generated by [this shell script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cookbooks/gitlab-server/-/blob/master/templates/default/ubuntu_advantage-metrics.erb?ref_type=heads), which is installed on all Chef managed VM instances.
- The script writes a file with Prometheus formatted metrics, where the node_exporter process then exports them to Prometheus.
- The metric `canonical_livepatch_enabled` is generated based on the output of the `ua status` command, where the statuses of "warning" or "enabled" are considered enabled, anything else is interpreted as not enabled.
- A Systemd timer is installed to execute this script every 5 minutes.

## Alert Behavior

- The alert looks for any instances enrolled into Ubuntu Pro in GPRD and report Livepatch as being disabled, while also having run chef-client recently.

## Severities

- This alert is low severity, and intended to inform us when there are nodes that may not be receiving security patches as we intend.

- You can verify the state of Livepatch on the machine using the command `sudo ua status`

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure chef-client runs are completing without error.
- If Chef is running, verify that the attribute that enables the Livepatch feature is set to `true`:
  - ```knife search node 'name:<nodename>' -a gitlab-server.ubuntu-advantage.livepatch```

## Possible Resolutions

- If the attribute mentioned above is false, find the roles associated with the node, and check to see if there is a misconfiguration that is resulting in the attribute being overridden.
- From the `ua status` command, ensure that the node is associated with our Ubuntu Advantage account.

## Dependencies

- Chef needs to be running on the instance for this alert to function.

# Escalation

- If this alert fires, it is likely a good idea to first check with the service owner for the VM instance, and see if this isn't intentional.
- For generic Livepatch related help, you can reach out in `#g_production-engineering_ops` in Slack.
