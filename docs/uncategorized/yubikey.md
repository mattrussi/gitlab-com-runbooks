# Configuring and Using the Yubikey

**Table of Contents**

[TOC]

The following setup enables us to use the YubiKey with OpenPGP, the Authentication subkey [as an SSH key](https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/SSH_authentication/) and the Encryption subkey to sign Git commits.

:warning:

**Consider setting up 2 Yubikeys.  Keys will fail, so having a backup reduces the pain and grief when failures occur.**

## The Tooling

You'll be using the following tooling:

* [`yubikey-agent`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent)
* [`ykman`](https://docs.yubico.com/software/yubikey/tools/ykman/)

### Setup Instructions

**WARNING**: When setting a pin, make sure it is between 6 and 8 ASCII characters, longer pins may be silently truncated.

1. Follow the instructions for [installing `yubikey-agent`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent#installation). **But do not run the `setup` command for your yubikey. This is handled as part of the yubikey-reset.sh script below.**
   * Don't forget to add `export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$(brew --prefix)/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock"` to your `~/.zshrc` and restart the shell.
1. Follow the instructions for [installing `ykman`](https://docs.yubico.com/software/yubikey/tools/ykman/)
1. Follow the instructions below for setting a "cached" touch policy. These steps, and the script run, will create keys and certificates using ykman.
1. Set up Git commit signing using the YubiKey's SSH key:

   1. Export the YubiKey's public key to the file system

      ```shell
      ssh-add -L | grep YubiKey >~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_yubikey.pub
      ```

   1. [Configure Git to use your SSH key for signing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/signed_commits/ssh.html#configure-git-to-sign-commits-with-your-ssh-key), referencing the file created above.
   1. Add the SSH key to your GitLab profile:
      * [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/ssh_keys)
      * [ops.gitlab.net](https://ops.gitlab.net/-/user_settings/ssh_keys)
      * [dev.gitlab.org](https://dev.gitlab.org/-/user_settings/ssh_keys/)

1. Enable 2FA with the Yubikey for your favorite services, e.g.:
   * GitLab
   * Okta
   * AWS
   * Google

### Setting a ["cached" touch policy](https://docs.yubico.com/yesdk/users-manual/application-piv/pin-touch-policies.html)

**When following the below instructions, your YubiKey's PIV application will be reset. Existing FIDO
applications where this YubiKey is used will not be affected.[^1]**

When doing a rebase with multiple commits, or using ssh automation like `knife ssh ...` it will be painful using the default `yubikey-agent` configuration since a touch is required for every signature or ssh session.
This is default configuration but we set a touch policy of "cached" with the following script, this will cache touches for 15 seconds:

1. Validate `ykman` has access to the key, you may need to re-insert your yubikey, run `ykman info` to confirm.
1. Run the [`scripts/yubikey-reset.sh` script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/scripts/reset-yubikey.sh), `PIN=<your pin> scripts/reset-yubikey.sh`, **this will invalidate the previous key and set a new one**:

### Workaround if your YubiKey is not responding

If you discover that your yubikey is not responding, a restart of the `yubikey-agent` may be needed. Usually `ssh-add -l` will throw an error.

Run the following brew command on your local machine.

```
brew services restart yubikey-agent
```

We suspect that this is impacting only Macbook / macOS users.

### Extra Setup for GNOME Users

If you are using [a Linux laptop](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/linux/) with
either the GNOME Display Manager (GDM) as the login manager or GNOME as the desktop environment,
then further steps are _recommended_ to improve the setup.

#### Disable smart card authentication within GDM

We are using the `pcscd` daemon, which was originally used for smartcard-based login. GDM will
automatically prefer smart card authentication over password-based authentication, if the laptop has
`pcscd` running and is booted with the YubiKey plugged in.

In order to disable smart card authentication, we can update the settings usign this command:

``` shell
sudo -u gdm dbus-launch --exit-with-session env DCONF_PROFILE=gdm gsettings set org.gnome.login-screen enable-smartcard-authentication false
```

The value for this setting can be verified using `gsettings`:

``` shell
sudo -u gdm env DCONF_PROFILE=gdm gsettings get org.gnome.login-screen enable-smartcard-authentication
```

#### Disable `gsd_smartcard` from running on start-up

GNOME Settings Daemon (GSD) is one of the components of the GNOME Desktop environment which runs when a
GNOME session is started. GSD has several plugins, and one of the plugins is
`org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Smartcard`. This plugin runs the program `gsd_smartcard` which opens a
connection to the YubiKey.

This prevents `yubikey-agent` from connecting to the YubiKey. The following error an be seen in the journal:

``` shell
$ ssh-add -L
error fetching identities: agent refused operation

$ journalctl --user -u yubikey-agent.service | rg -i other | tail -1
Jan 14 14:51:30 work-dell-1 yubikey-agent[21389]: 2025/01/14 14:51:30 agent 11: could not reach YubiKey: connecting to smart card: the smart card cannot be accessed because of other connections outstanding
```

To see whether `gsd_smartcard` is the root cause of this error, you can use `lsof` and see the users
of the PCSCD socket as described
[here](https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent/issues/111#issuecomment-2478402886):

``` shell
$ sudo lsof +E /run/pcscd/pcscd.comm
COMMAND    PID      USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF  NODE NAME
[snip]
gsd-smart 3449 siddharth    8u  unix 0xffff8a5bccf4a400      0t0 16052 type=STREAM ->INO=4724 2220,pcscd,14u
gsd-smart 3449 siddharth    9u  unix 0xffff8a5bf9711c00      0t0 18246 type=STREAM ->INO=13132 2220,pcscd,15u
```

You can stop the `gsd_smartcard` process from running on start-up by masking the related Systemd
unit:[^2]

``` shell
$ systemctl --user mask org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Smartcard.target
Created symlink /home/siddharth/.config/systemd/user/org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Smartcard.target â†’ /dev/null.
```

### Limitation: Keeping multiple YubiKeys connected

If you have multiple YubiKeys connected to your machine, there is no way to select a single YubiKey
to be used within `yubikey-agent`. [The current
logic](https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent/blob/2e5376c5ec006250c12c1b6de65fa91de9afe687/main.go#L195-L196)
uses the first YubiKey which can be opened.
