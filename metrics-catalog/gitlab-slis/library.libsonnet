      These signifies operations that reach out to a language model with a prompt. These interactions
      with an AI provider are executed within `Llm::CompletionWorker`-jobs. The worker could execute multiple
      requests to an AI provider for a single operation.

      A success means that we were able to present the user with a response that is delivered to a client that is
      subscribed to a websocket. An error could be that the AI-provider is not responding, or is erroring.

      For the apdex, we consider an operation fast enough if we were able to get a complete response from the AI provider within
      20 seconds. This not include the time it took for the Sidekiq job to get picked up, or the time it took to deliver
      the response to the client.

      The `service_class` label on the source metrics tells us which AI related features the operation is for.

      These operations do not go through the API gateway yet, but will in the future.
