        ExternalDNS has not synced successfully with Google Cloud DNS in
        cluster {{.labels.cluster}} (region {{.labels.region}}) in the last
        five minutes. This can lead to missing or outdated DNS entries, which
        might lead to service disruption. Check the ExternalDNS logs for more
        information.
