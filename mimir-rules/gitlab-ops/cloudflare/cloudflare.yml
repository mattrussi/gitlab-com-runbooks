          description: >
            The cloudflare exporter has failed to scrape Cloudflare for 10
            minutes. Note that this refers to a background scrape loop in the
            exporter itself, and that prometheus may be successfully scraping
            the exporter.

            One or more clients consuming features delivered through Cloud Connector was blocked by
            our rate limit rules in Cloudflare for 5 minutes or more. This could be OK but should
            be investigated for false positives.
