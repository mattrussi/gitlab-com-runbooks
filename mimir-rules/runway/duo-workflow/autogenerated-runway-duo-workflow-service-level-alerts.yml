        This SLI monitors all Duo Workflow GRPC requests. GRPC failures which are considered to be the "server's fault" are counted as errors.

        This alert signifies that the SLI was previously reporting traffic, but is no longer - the signal is absent.

        This could be caused by a change to the metrics used in the SLI, or by the service not receiving traffic.
