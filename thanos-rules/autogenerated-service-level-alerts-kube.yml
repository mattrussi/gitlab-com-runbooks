      title: The apiserver SLI of the kube service (`{{ $labels.stage }}` stage) has
        not received any traffic in the past 30 minutes
      description: |
        The Kubernetes API server validates and configures data for the api objects which include pods, services, and others. The API Server services REST operations and provides the frontend to the cluster's shared state through which all other components interact.

        This SLI measures all non-health-check endpoints. Long-polling endpoints are excluded from apdex scores.

        This alert signifies that the SLI is reporting a cessation of traffic, but the signal is not absent.

        This SLI measures all non-health-check endpoints. Long-polling endpoints are excluded from apdex scores.

        This alert signifies that the SLI was previously reporting traffic, but is no longer - the signal is absent.

        This could be caused by a change to the metrics used in the SLI, or by the service not receiving traffic.
